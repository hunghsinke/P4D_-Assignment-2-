        <h2>Exercise Notes</h2>
        <p>My logo design contains the use of a unique eight sided shape, the use of different colours and sizes of circles.
            You can access the differnt circles by refreshing the page. 
            You can also see that I have my name and a fish made from circle and triangle on the page. 
            I pick the background colour orange, and set the canvas colour to light grey because I think it brings out the differnt colour a bit more.
