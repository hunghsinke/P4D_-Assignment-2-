        <ul>
            <li><p>My &lt;logo design&gt; needs to be refreshed by the user each time to create the <strong>beautiful random circles</strong> that compliments my design.</p></li>
            <li><p>My &lt;animation design&gt; are multiple squares turning in different directions and turning. It looks hypnotising and I think it's pretty fun! The aqua background colour also complements it very well.</p></li>
            <li> <p>My &lt;interaction design&gt; looks simple at first, but after you move your cursor onto canvas you'll be able to see random bubbles shooting out from your cursor.
                Your cursor also changes to a <b>hand</b>. The bubbles comes in different colours and it will stay on canvas afte a while, making it look like an aquarium!
