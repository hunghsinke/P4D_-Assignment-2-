            My &lt;interaction design&gt; lMy interaction design may seem simple at first glance, but it's a delightful surprise. As you hover your cursor over the canvas, you'll witness a playful display of random bubbles shooting out from your pointer. It's not just your cursor that transforms; it morphs into a hand, inviting you to explore this interactive world. These bubbles, each adorned in different colors, gracefully linger on the canvas, creating an enchanting aquarium-like atmosphere. It's a whimsical and engaging experience that adds an element of surprise and interactivity, turning your canvas into a captivating digital playground for users to enjoy.
